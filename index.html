        <h1>Keanu's Day Out</h1>
    </header>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Hello, my name is Keanu and this is my website. I am a 7 years old ginger and I absolutely fit the stereotype of being crazy.</b> </p>
    <p> The other day started like any other with me waking up my peasants for my food. It was delicious, best food I have ever had. They creatures brought out these weird containers that they kept trying to shove me into. I knew something bad was going to happen...the bad place. I always get poked and prodded there. I made those creatures pay, I pooped in the moving box they take me to the bad place in. </p>
